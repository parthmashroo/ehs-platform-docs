# Phase 6 — Audit Logging: Status & Notes

> Read this when working on any Phase 6 ticket.

## Tickets

| Ticket | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| EHS-56 | AuditLog entity + EF config + migration | ✅ Done |
| EHS-57 | AuditInterceptor (SaveChangesInterceptor) — before/after JSON on all auditable entities | ✅ Done |
| EHS-62 | Global DateTime → DateTimeOffset sweep — BaseEntity, all entities, commands, validators, DTOs, AuditInterceptor, migration | ✅ Done |
| EHS-58 | GET /api/incidents/{id}/audit-log + GET /api/correctiveactions/{id}/audit-log | ✅ Done |
| EHS-59 | Phase 6 docs update | ✅ Done |

## EHS-58 Lessons Learned

- `AuditLog` has no Global Query Filter — the `TenantId` filter in the handler is mandatory. Missing it leaks cross-tenant audit data silently.
- `IgnoreQueryFilters()` on the Users join bypasses ALL filters on that DbSet — not just `IsDeleted`. If Users ever gets a TenantId filter, this silently becomes a cross-tenant name leak. Document this wherever `IgnoreQueryFilters()` appears on joins.
- Soft-deleted users show as `"FullName (Inactive)"` — achieved by `IgnoreQueryFilters()` + `DefaultIfEmpty()` + null check. Active user: FullName only. FK integrity (`DeleteBehavior.Restrict`) ensures the user record always exists; `"Unknown User"` is a true last-resort fallback.
- `AuditableEntity` enum replaces magic strings for `EntityName` — future entitlement gating (e.g. "this client only has Incident module") can gate on this enum directly.
- Authorization policy is config-driven via `appsettings.json` `AuthorizationPolicies` section — no role strings in code. `Policies` static class owns the policy name constant; `Program.cs` wires roles from config.
- `a.Action.ToString()` inside LINQ select may force client-side evaluation against SQL Server — safer to project the enum int and call `.ToString()` outside the query. Deferred; works correctly in tests and against InMemory.

## EHS-58 Design Notes (read before starting)

- AuditLog has **no Global Query Filter** (no `ITenantEntity`) — queries MUST manually filter by `TenantId`. Do not forget this.
- Response should return **field-level diffs**, not raw `OldValues`/`NewValues` JSON blobs — tracked as technical-debt.md #23.
- `ChangedById` is a FK to `Users` — resolve display name at read time, do not store inline.
- Scope: GET by entity id, scoped to tenant, paginated, ordered by `ChangedAt` descending.

## Phase 6 Lessons Learned

- `SaveChangesInterceptor` hooks into `SavingChanges` — NOT `SavedChanges`. For Guid PKs (client-assigned), the entity ID is available before the DB write, so audit rows can be built and added to ChangeTracker in `SavingChanges`. Both rows commit in the same transaction.
- Enum serialization: use `p.Metadata.ClrType` (schema-first) to detect enums, then `Nullable.GetUnderlyingType()` to unwrap nullable enums. Do not use `p.CurrentValue is Enum e` — runtime pattern match on null is coincidentally correct, not by design.
- `IsConcurrencyToken` check skips RowVersion from audit JSON — byte[] RowVersion columns must be excluded.
- DI wiring: `AddDbContext<T>((sp, options) => ...)` factory overload is required to resolve a scoped interceptor from DI. The simple `AddDbContext(options => ...)` has no `IServiceProvider` access.
- Pin `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory` to `8.0.0` when adding via CLI — without the version flag, `dotnet add package` resolves latest (10.x), which targets net10 and fails on net8.
- Architecture gap: `TenantId == Guid.Empty` on authenticated user → audit rows written with empty TenantId silently. Tracked in technical-debt.md.
- Test coverage gap: `CorrectiveAction` auditing not yet tested — `AuditableTypes` includes it but no test verifies `EntityName = "CorrectiveAction"`.

## EHS-59 Lessons Learned

- Phase 6 is complete. Interview cards Q51 (DateTimeOffset/UTC), Q52 (config-driven auth policies), Q53 (IgnoreQueryFilters safety) added to ehs-deep.html.
- Technical debt #25–27 captured in technical-debt.md from the EHS-58 review session.
- Two items deferred: `IncidentTimeZoneId nvarchar(50)` on Incident + migration; Testcontainers DateTimeOffset round-trip test. Both need Jira tickets before Phase 7 backlog is locked.

## Open Decisions (from EHS-62 architecture review)

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| JSON output format — emit Z suffix, not +00:00 | ✅ Done — `DateTimeOffsetUtcZConverter` wired in Program.cs |
| UTC normalization at validators — `.Must(x => x.Offset == TimeSpan.Zero)` | ✅ Done — all 4 validators updated |
| Named timezone storage — add `IncidentTimeZoneId nvarchar(50)` to Incident | ⬜ Ticket needed |
| Testcontainers round-trip test for datetimeoffset column | ⬜ Ticket needed |
