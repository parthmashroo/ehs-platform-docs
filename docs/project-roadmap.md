# EHS Platform — Full Technical Roadmap & Master Reference



## About This Document

This is the single source of truth for building the EHS (Environment, Health & Safety) SaaS platform.

Written so any AI assistant can resume this project with full context from any session.



**Developer:** .NET backend engineer, 11+ years experience. Learning modern stack while building.

**Goal:** Build a real production-quality EHS SaaS system — not a tutorial app.

**Practice machine:** Personal machine only. Never on company laptop.

**Current status:** Phase 0 ✅ Phase 1 ✅ Phase 2 ✅ Phase 3 ✅ Phase 4 ✅ Phase 5 next.



---



## What We Are Building



A **full EHS (Environment, Health & Safety) SaaS platform** for safety-critical industries

(construction, manufacturing, chemical plants, mining, energy).



Inspired by a real enterprise system (MAISAAS) the developer worked on previously.

That system was built on .NET Core 3.1, layered architecture, Razor MVC.

We are building the modern equivalent — better architecture, better stack, cloud-native.



### Two Types of Companies Use This Platform



**Client (Site Owner):**

The company that owns the workplace/site. A factory, construction site, oil platform.

They have authority, oversight, compliance responsibility, and approval power.

They manage safety across their site, including contractors who come to work there.



**Contractor:**

The company that sends workers to perform work at the client's site.

They execute work, submit compliance documents, report incidents, complete training.



This Client vs Contractor distinction is fundamental. It drives the entire authorization model,

the data model (CompanyType enum), and what each user can see and do.



---



## The Anti-Procrastination Rules (Non-Negotiable)



The developer is a self-identified procrastinator and overthinker. These rules prevent abandonment:



1. **One phase at a time.** Never plan Phase 5 while building Phase 1.

2. **Each session ends with working, committed code.** No half-finished features.

3. **No gold-plating early phases.** Phase 1 is intentionally ugly. That is correct.

4. **Decisions are made once.** Technology choices are locked. Don't revisit.

5. **Done is better than perfect.** A working ugly endpoint beats a perfectly designed nothing.

6. **Minimum viable phase.** If a phase feels too big, cut it in half. Ship something.

7. **No rabbit holes.** New interesting ideas go in a future phase note. Not now.



**If the developer starts scope-creeping or re-debating decided things, remind them of these rules.**



---



## Decisions Already Made (Never Revisit)



### Portal Architecture

- **Single React app with role-based views.** NOT two separate apps.

- One codebase, one deployment. The app reads the user's role/company type on login and renders

  different dashboards, navigation, and screens accordingly.

- Later if needed: `client.app.com` and `contractor.app.com` subdomains via DNS + nginx config

  pointing at the same deployed app. Zero extra code. Subdomain context sets initial routing.



### Form Engine Scope

- Core business entities (Incident, CorrectiveAction, WorkPermit, etc.) stay as **proper typed entities**

  with strongly typed fields in the database.

- The Dynamic Form Engine handles **supplementary data collection** — risk assessment checklists,

  site inspection forms, toolbox talk records, custom questionnaires, audit checklists, induction forms.

- How/whether to integrate core module forms with the form engine is a future decision.



### ISO Templates

- Seed a small number of example templates when the form engine is built (Phase 7) to prove it works.

- ISO-compliant template packs (ISO 45001, ISO 9001, OSHA) are a **commercial product decision** —

  built when paying customers ask for them. Not before.



### Notifications

- **Outbox Pattern** — when a command executes, it saves a domain event to an OutboxMessage table

  in the same database transaction. A background worker reads and processes it (sends email).

- No RabbitMQ for now. Azure Service Bus added in a later phase when scale requires it.



### Auth

- JWT generated **inside the API** — no separate IdentityServer or auth service.

- SCIM 2.0 / Azure AD / Okta SSO integration added in a later phase for enterprise customers.

## Full Technology Stack



### Backend

| Concern | Technology | Why |

|---|---|---|

| Framework | .NET 8 Web API | Modern LTS |

| Architecture | Clean Architecture | Domain / Application / Infrastructure / API layers |

| Pattern | CQRS + MediatR | Separates reads/writes, pipeline behaviors |

| ORM | Entity Framework Core 8 | Code-first, migrations, interceptors for audit |

| Validation | FluentValidation | Declarative, in MediatR pipeline |

| Mapping | Mapster | Faster than AutoMapper |

| Logging | Serilog | Structured logging, Azure App Insights sink |

| Auth | JWT Bearer tokens | Standard, stateless |

| Caching | Redis (StackExchange.Redis) | Distributed cache |

| Resilience | Polly | Retry, circuit breaker |

| Background Jobs | BackgroundService + PeriodicTimer | Built-in .NET 8 |

| Notifications | Outbox Pattern → email | Reliable async delivery |

| Testing | xUnit + Moq + FluentAssertions | Industry standard |

| API Docs | Swagger / Scalar | Auto-generated |

| Error Format | Problem Details (RFC 7807) | Standard HTTP errors |



### Frontend

| Concern | Technology |

|---|---|

| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript |

| Build Tool | Vite |

| Routing | React Router v6 |

| Server State | TanStack Query (React Query) |

| Client State | Zustand |

| UI Components | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |

| HTTP Client | Axios (with auth interceptors) |

| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod |



### Infrastructure

| Concern | Technology |

|---|---|

| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |

| Hosting | Azure Container Apps |

| Database | Azure SQL (SQL Server locally via Docker) |

| Caching | Azure Cache for Redis |

| Secrets | Azure Key Vault |

| File Storage | Azure Blob Storage |

| Messaging | Azure Service Bus (Phase 15+) |

| Monitoring | Azure Application Insights |

| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |



### Architecture Decisions (Locked)

- **Multi-tenancy:** Row-level isolation via EF Core Global Query Filters on TenantId.

  Single database, all tenants share tables, filtered automatically.

- **CompanyType:** Every Organization is either `Client` (1) or `Contractor` (2). Fundamental.

- **Site Hierarchy:** Organization → Site → SiteArea. Incidents, permits, etc. link to a Site.

- **Audit logging:** EF Core SaveChanges interceptor captures before/after on all auditable entities.

- **CQRS:** Commands (writes) and Queries (reads) are separate MediatR handlers. No sharing.

- **Soft deletes:** IsActive / IsDeleted flag everywhere. No hard deletes.

- **Permission system:** Module-level + Action-level permissions per role (not just role names).

- **Lookup tables:** Some domain data (e.g., SiteArea names, custom incident categories) is DB-driven

  per tenant, not hardcoded enums. This allows tenant customisation without code changes.

- **Outbox pattern:** Domain events persisted to OutboxMessage in same transaction as business data.

  Background worker processes and delivers. Replaces need for message broker in early phases.



### Clean Architecture Layers

- `Domain` — Entities, Value Objects, Enums, Domain Events, Interfaces. Zero dependencies.

- `Application` — Commands, Queries, Handlers, DTOs, Validators, Interfaces. Depends on Domain only.

- `Infrastructure` — EF Core, Repositories, Azure clients, Email, Cache. Depends on Application.

- `API` — Controllers, Middleware, Startup. Depends on Application (not Infrastructure directly).



### MediatR Pipeline (every request goes through this)

```

ValidationBehaviour     → auto-validates every command via FluentValidation

LoggingBehaviour        → logs every command/query with execution time

AuditBehaviour          → records every write to AuditLog table

→ Command/Query Handler → business logic

```



### Middleware Pipeline Order

```

1. CorrelationIdMiddleware      — assigns request ID

2. ExceptionHandlingMiddleware  — catches all errors, returns Problem Details

3. Serilog request logging

4. HTTPS redirection

5. Authentication               — validates JWT

6. Authorization                — checks roles/policies

7. TenantResolutionMiddleware   — extracts TenantId + CompanyType from JWT

8. Controllers

```

## Incident Status State Machine

```

Reported → UnderInvestigation → AwaitingAction → Resolved → Closed

↑ ↓

└──── (re-open) ───────┘



Rules:

- Reported: Initial state on creation

- UnderInvestigation: Requires AssignedToId to be set

- AwaitingAction: Requires RootCause to be filled

- Resolved: Requires all linked CorrectiveActions to be Completed or Verified

- Closed: Final state. Only SafetyOfficer or OrganizationAdmin

- Any state → Reported: "Re-opened" — adds audit entry

```

## Phases of Development



> Rule: **Each phase produces working, committed, runnable code.**

> No phase starts until the previous one is DONE.



---



### Phase 0: Project Skeleton ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** A running .NET 8 API that returns a health check. Nothing more.



- [ ] Create GitHub repository

- [ ] `dotnet new sln` — solution with 4 projects (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)

- [ ] Project references: API → Infrastructure → Application → Domain

- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` with SQL Server 2022

- [ ] `Program.cs` — Swagger, health check endpoint `/health`

- [ ] Serilog basic console logging

- [ ] Global exception middleware skeleton (catches and returns Problem Details)

- [ ] `.gitignore`, `README.md`

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 0: Project skeleton"`



**Done when:** `docker-compose up` starts SQL Server, `dotnet run` starts API, `/health` returns 200.



--- 

### Phase 1: Core Domain + Incident Reporting (No Auth) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Create and retrieve incidents. No auth. No multi-tenancy. Just the core loop.



New concepts: Clean Architecture structure, EF Core code-first, first migration, MediatR, FluentValidation, CQRS in practice.



- [ ] BaseEntity.cs (Id, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)

- [ ] Organization, Site, SiteArea entities

- [ ] CompanyType enum

- [ ] Incident entity + IncidentType, Severity, IncidentStatus enums

- [ ] ApplicationDbContext with DbSets

- [ ] IEntityTypeConfiguration per entity

- [ ] First EF migration

- [ ] CreateIncidentCommand + Handler + Validator

- [ ] GetIncidentsQuery + Handler (simple list)

- [ ] GetIncidentByIdQuery + Handler

- [ ] IncidentsController (POST, GET)

- [ ] ValidationBehaviour in MediatR pipeline

- [ ] Test: create incident via Swagger, retrieve it



**Done when:** POST an incident, GET it back. Stored in SQL Server.



---



### Phase 2: Incident Lifecycle — Status Machine ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Incidents have an enforced lifecycle.



New concepts: State machine in domain, domain exceptions, PUT/PATCH endpoints, pagination, filtering.



- [ ] `Incident.TransitionTo(newStatus)` — domain method, enforces rules

- [ ] `InvalidStatusTransitionException`

- [ ] UpdateIncidentCommand + Handler

- [ ] UpdateIncidentStatusCommand + Handler

- [ ] AssignIncidentCommand + Handler

- [ ] PaginatedList<T> + update GetIncidents (page, size, filters)

- [ ] Filter by status, severity, type, site

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 2: Incident status machine"`



**Done when:** Can't skip from Reported to Closed. Status transitions enforced.



---



### Phase 3: Corrective Actions ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Incidents have corrective actions. CAs block incident resolution.



New concepts: One-to-many in EF, nested resources, cross-entity business rules.



- [x] CorrectiveAction entity + enums (Priority, CorrectiveActionStatus)
- [x] EF relationship + migration (nullable IncidentId FK, filtered index — ADR-011)
- [x] CRUD commands/queries for CAs (Create, Update, UpdateStatus, SoftDelete, GetList, GetById)
- [x] CorrectiveAction.TransitionTo() domain method with state machine + guard clauses
- [x] CorrectiveActionsController (POST, GET list, GET by id, PUT, PATCH /status, DELETE)
- [x] Unit tests — 10 for Incident.TransitionTo(), 12 for CorrectiveAction.TransitionTo() + new CA guard
- [x] Business rule: Incident → Resolved only if all CAs are Completed/Verified
- [x] GetIncidentByIdQuery includes CAs in response



**Done when:** CA blocks incident resolution. Verified in Swagger.



---



### Phase 4: Users & Authentication ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Real users with JWT. Roles enforced on endpoints.



New concepts: JWT in .NET 8, role-based authorization, password hashing, ICurrentUserService.



- [x] User entity + UserRole enum (all 8 roles)

- [x] AuthController: Register (creates Organization + first Admin user), Login

- [x] JWT generation with claims: userId, tenantId, companyType, email, role

- [x] ICurrentUserService + implementation via IHttpContextAccessor

- [x] [Authorize] on all incident/CA endpoints. [AllowAnonymous] on AuthController.

- [x] ForbiddenAccessException → 403 in ExceptionHandlingMiddleware

- [x] Role restrictions: only SafetyOfficer/OrganizationAdmin can close incidents (handler-level guard, Phase 8 replaces with permissions layer)

- [x] ReportedById on Incident wired from ICurrentUserService.UserId (removed from request body)

- [x] AssignIncidentHandler validates assignee exists and is active in DB

- [x] 15 Application tests + 22 Domain tests all passing

- [x] EHS-45 logged: Architecture Spike — Concurrency, Consistency, Auditability & Traceability (to be resolved before Phase 5 code is written)



**Done when:** Must login to use API. Role restrictions enforced. ✅



---



### Phase 5: Multi-tenancy

**Goal:** Client orgs and contractor orgs are completely isolated.



New concepts: EF Core Global Query Filters, TenantResolutionMiddleware, ITenantService.



- [ ] Add TenantId to all entities

- [ ] ClientContractor entity (maps which contractors work for which clients)

- [ ] TenantResolutionMiddleware (extracts tenantId + companyType from JWT)

- [ ] Global Query Filters on all tenant-scoped entities

- [ ] Migration to add TenantId columns

- [ ] Registration flow creates Organization + first Admin user

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 5: Multi-tenancy"`



**Done when:** Two orgs' data is completely isolated. Verified with two accounts.



---



### Phase 6: Audit Logging

**Goal:** Every change recorded with who, what, when, before/after.



New concepts: EF Core SaveChanges interceptors, immutable audit tables, change tracking.



- [ ] AuditLog entity + migration

- [ ] AuditInterceptor: SaveChangesInterceptor captures entity changes as JSON

- [ ] GET /api/incidents/{id}/audit-log endpoint

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 6: Audit logging"`



**Done when:** Every incident update creates an immutable audit record.



---



### Phase 7: Dynamic Form Engine

**Goal:** Generic form builder. Companies can create custom assessment forms.

Seed 2-3 example templates (risk assessment, site inspection).



New concepts: Dynamic/data-driven UI patterns, JSON-stored config, EAV-adjacent patterns.



- [ ] FormTemplate, FormSection, FormField entities + migration

- [ ] FormSubmission, FormFieldAnswer entities

- [ ] CRUD for FormTemplate (create, get, clone)

- [ ] Submit a form (FormSubmission + answers)

- [ ] Link submission to an entity (LinkedEntityType, LinkedEntityId)

- [ ] Seed 2-3 example templates

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 7: Dynamic form engine"`



**Done when:** Can create a form template, submit responses, retrieve answers.



---



### Phase 8: Caching (Redis)

**Goal:** Reference data cached. Reduces DB load.



- [ ] Add Redis to docker-compose.yml

- [ ] ICacheService interface + RedisCacheService

- [ ] Cache site/area lookups, user permission checks

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 8: Redis caching"`



---



### Phase 9: Background Workers + Outbox Pattern

**Goal:** Reliable notifications. Overdue CA detection.



New concepts: BackgroundService, PeriodicTimer, Outbox pattern.



- [ ] OutboxMessage entity + migration

- [ ] OutboxProcessorJob: reads OutboxMessage table, sends emails, marks processed

- [ ] OverdueCaJob: finds CAs past DueDate, creates OutboxMessages

- [ ] Basic email delivery (SendGrid or SMTP)

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 9: Background workers and outbox"`



**Done when:** Overdue CAs trigger email notifications reliably.



---



### Phase 10: File Attachments

**Goal:** Incidents can have photos/documents.



- [ ] Azure Blob Storage (local: Azurite emulator)

- [ ] IBlobStorageService interface + implementation

- [ ] IncidentAttachment entity

- [ ] POST /api/incidents/{id}/attachments

- [ ] GET /api/incidents/{id}/attachments

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 10: File attachments"`



---



### Phase 11: Dashboard & Reporting

**Goal:** Summary stats. Something a safety manager would actually use.



- [ ] GET /api/dashboard/summary — total incidents, by status, by severity, overdue CAs

- [ ] GET /api/reports/incidents — filtered list

- [ ] Optimized queries (no N+1)

- [ ] Commit: `"Phase 11: Dashboard and reporting"`



---



### Phase 12: React Frontend

**Goal:** Working UI for core flows. Role-based views.



Screens:

1. Login / Register

2. Dashboard (role-aware — Safety Officer sees different data than Contractor Worker)

3. Incident list (table with filters)

4. Create incident form

5. Incident detail (with CAs, audit log)

6. Create corrective action

7. Form builder UI (Phase 7 engine) — basic

8. Site/Area management



**Done when:** Can login, see role-specific dashboard, create incident, add CA — all via UI.



---



### Phase 13: Work Permit Management

**Goal:** Full work permit lifecycle built on top of existing platform.



(Work permits are the most complex module in EHS — gas testing, isolations, PPE, multi-step approvals)



---



### Phase 14: Document Management

**Goal:** Compliance document repository with expiry tracking.



---



### Phase 15: Compliance Audit Management

**Goal:** Conduct formal compliance audits, findings, corrective actions.



---



### Phase 16: Azure Deployment + CI/CD

**Goal:** Production-quality deployment. Live on Azure.



- [ ] Dockerfile for API

- [ ] Dockerfile for frontend

- [ ] Azure Container Registry

- [ ] Azure Container Apps

- [ ] Azure SQL Database

- [ ] Azure Cache for Redis

- [ ] Azure Key Vault for secrets

- [ ] GitHub Actions: build → test → push → deploy on merge to main

- [ ] Azure Application Insights



**Done when:** Push to main automatically deploys to Azure. App is live.



---



### Phase 17: AI-First Integration

**Goal:** Not "AI as a feature" — the platform built so AI agents can operate it natively.

Full strategic rationale: see [ai-first-strategy.md](ai-first-strategy.md)

**Domain AI features (original scope — kept):**
- **Incident Classification:** AI suggests Type and Severity from description text
- **Pattern Detection:** "You've had 5 similar incidents in 30 days — review X procedure"
- **Risk Scoring:** AI scores new incidents for likely severity escalation
- **Compliance Report Generation:** AI narrative summary for a date range (streaming)
- **Form Template Generator:** Describe what you need, AI generates a form template

**AI-Native Infrastructure (added scope):**
- **EHS MCP Server** — production MCP server exposing the full API surface as typed AI tools.
  Any AI assistant (Claude, Copilot, etc.) can call our platform directly.
  MCP tools map 1:1 to existing MediatR Commands/Queries — no new business logic.
- **AI Service Principal** — a user type representing an AI agent. All agent actions are
  fully attributed and audited like human actions.
- **Domain Event Subscriptions** — AI agents subscribe to Outbox events (incident created,
  CA overdue, permit expiring) and react without polling.
- **ERP/CRM Integration via AI** — AI orchestrator mediates between our MCP server and
  ERP MCP servers (SAP, Oracle EAM, Dynamics 365). Intent-based, not field-mapping-based.
  Work Permit (Phase 13) is the primary ERP integration bridge.

**Tech:** Claude API (Anthropic .NET SDK), `ModelContextProtocol` NuGet for MCP server,
streaming responses for reports. Runs in the same API process — no new infrastructure.

## Development Environment Setup (To Do in Phase 0 Session)



### Prerequisites (Personal Machine)

- .NET 8 SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0

- Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

- VS Code or Visual Studio 2022 Community

- Git

- Node.js 20+ (for frontend phases)



### Local Run (after Phase 0)

```bash

docker-compose up -d # starts SQL Server (+ Redis from Phase 8)

dotnet ef database update # applies migrations

dotnet run --project src/EHSPlatform.API

# open https://localhost:{port}/swagger

```

## What MAISAAS Had That We Will Add in Later Phases



| MAISAAS Module | Our Equivalent | Phase |

|---|---|---|

| Work Permit Management | Phase 13 | Later |

| Document Management (with expiry) | Phase 14 | Later |

| Audit Management (compliance audits) | Phase 15 | Later |

| Training & Skills | Future | Much later |

| Check-in / Check-out (QR, badges) | Future | Optional |

| Vendor/Contractor Rating | Future | Optional |

| Minutes of Meeting | Probably skip | Skip |

| SCIM 2.0 / SSO | Future | Enterprise phase |

| Power BI integration | Future | Enterprise phase |

| RabbitMQ | Replaced by Outbox Pattern | Already decided |

| Quartz.NET | Replaced by .NET BackgroundService | Already decided |



## What We Have That MAISAAS Didn't



| Our Addition | Why |

|---|---|

| Clean Architecture + CQRS | Testable, maintainable, scalable |

| MediatR pipeline behaviors | Automatic validation/logging/audit on every request |

| Dynamic Form Engine | Their questionnaire, plus future integration with modules |

| ISO template library | Commercial differentiator (future) |

| AI integration | Pattern detection, classification, report generation |

| React SPA | Modern frontend vs Razor MVC |

| Outbox Pattern | Reliable notifications without RabbitMQ complexity |

| Domain logic in entities | Not anemic domain model like MAISAAS |

| Full test suite | MAISAAS had no tests |

## Session Resume Instructions (For Any AI Assistant)



1. Read this file completely before doing anything else

2. Read career-profile.md for developer context

3. Check which phases are marked complete (checkboxes above)

4. Ask the developer which phase they want to work on

5. **Never re-debate decided things** — all decisions in this document are locked

6. Remind the developer of anti-procrastination rules if they start scope-creeping

7. The developer practices on a **personal machine only** — not the company laptop

8. Goal for each session: end with committed, runnable code



**Current status: Phase 0 ✅ Phase 1 ✅ Phase 2 ✅ Phase 3 ✅ Phase 4 ✅ Phase 5 next.**
